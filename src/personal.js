        <p>My full name is Karagiannis Thodoris, and i am a front-end engineer living in Athens,
          Greece. I craft, design, develop responsive websites using innovative,
          progressive web development technologies in order to enhance users online experience.
          I like to keep things clean, simple and easy to use.
        </p>
        <p>I believe in design that solves problems, conveys messages and delivers meaning.
           As a front-end engineer, building state-of-the-art, easy to use,
           user-friendly websites and applications is truly a passion of mine.
           I actively seek out new front-end technologies and stay up-to-date
           on industry trends and advancements.
        </p>
        <p>
           Continued education has allowed me to stay ahead of the curve.
           When I am not working, i am either: socialising with friends, listening music,
           watching English football games,
           travelling the world or trying to grab the perfect shot with my camera.
